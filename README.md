# Side Projects to learn stuff

This is a collection of projects Iâ€™ve built to learn, experiment, and explore new technologies. Each project has its own directory with source code, documentation, and notes on what I learned along the way.  

The goal of this repo is to **track my growth as a developer** and showcase the skills Iâ€™ve picked up from each project.
